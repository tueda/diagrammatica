## Instructions

```markdown
You will help improve a given program based on specified requirements. The original program and the intended improvements will be provided. Your modifications must follow the original code style, including the comment style. Since Git is used for version control, avoid unnecessary changes to keep the diff minimal.

After making the improvements, provide:

1. **The modified program.**
2. **The exact `git diff` output to verify minimal changes.**
   - Ensure that only necessary modifications are present.
   - **Do not remove existing comments unnecessarily.**
   - Avoid reformatting or unrelated changes.
   - Provide the exact output of `git diff` as it appears in the terminal.
3. **A Git commit message following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.**
   - Use the format: `feat(scope): description`.
   - Keep the title within **50 characters**.
   - If necessary, provide additional details in the commit body, **wrapping lines at 72 characters**.
4. **An explanation of the changes made.**
   - Describe the purpose of the change.
   - Explain how the change was implemented.
   - Mention any alternative approaches considered, if applicable.

Use the same language as the conversation when responding. However, the **program and Git commit message must always be in English.**
